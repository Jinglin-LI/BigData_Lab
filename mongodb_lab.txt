db.restaurants.find(cuisine: "Italian", borough: "Manhattan"}, {name: 1})


6. Display just the names of those restaurants where the cuisine is Italian and who have
db.restaurants.find(cuisine: "Italian", grades_grade: "A"}, {name: 1}).count()


7. 
db.restaurants.distinct("cuisine").length

8. Find dthe count of restaurants grouped by borough:
db.restaurants.aggregate {
	[
	{ $group: {"_id" : "$cuisine", "count":{$sum:1}}]
}

db.restaurants.aggregate {
	[
		{ $match : {"cuisine": "Chinese"}
	]

}

command:
hbase shell 
create 'customer', {NAME => 'addr'}, {NAME=> 'order'}
hbase(main):003 >  put 'customer', ''
hbase(main):003 >  get 'customer' 'jsmith'



notes:
HBase 
	-create table_name col_fam1
	-put command
	put 'table_name' 'rowid' 'col_fam1:col1' 'value'
	
	-get command
	get 'table_name' 'rowid'
when to use HBase
	- works natively with Hadoop
	- uses Hadoop storage
	- lower latency than Hadoop
	- used for random read/write
	- timestamping
	- useful for structured (tabular) and semi-structured date
	- auto-scaling
	
Disadvantages:
	-two singles points of failure
		- namenode
		- HMaster
	- cannot guarantee  5 9'S
	
Cassandra:
	- p2p (no master)
	- massively linearly scalable
		(2x node -> 2x throughput)
	- architecture is complex, developer doesn't need to be aware of distribution
		CQL (!SQL)
	- 4 ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS:
		- node
		- rack
		- data center
		- cluster
	- p2p
		node settings:
			cluster_name
			seeds -> initial peers that tell you about network ...
			listen_address
