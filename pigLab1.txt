1. Load the following datasets

divs = load '/pigData/NYSE_dividends' as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray,date:chararray, dividends:float);
daily = load '/pigData/NYSE_daily' as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float);
-- The following also works, untyped
--divs = load '/pigData/NYSE_dividends' as (exchange, symbol, date, dividends); 
--daily = load '/pigData/NYSE_daily' as (exchange, symbol, date, open, high, low, close, volume, adj_close); 
players = load '/pigData/baseball' as (name:chararray, team:chararray, position:bag{t:(p:chararray)}, bat:map[]);
crawl = load '/pigData/webcrawl' as (url, pageid, outpages:bag{t:(p:chararray)} );
Note: These files can also be downloaded from http://www.utdallas.edu/~axn112530/cs6350/pigData/


2. From the NYSE_daily file, find the difference between close and open price for each stock for each day




3. From the NYSE_dividends file, find the total dividends paid by each company so far



4. From the NYSE_dividends file, find the total average dividend paid by those companies whose name starts with CM



5. From the NYSE_daily, generate a listing of all the unique stocks


6. Join the two tables on the symbol key and then filter the joined relation by those stocks whose closing price is > 10. Then create a random 10% sample of the output and display on screen.


7. For the NYSE_daily dataset group by the symbol and find the average daily close for each group. Then order the data using average closing price in a descending way.
You have to use a 10 reducers for the average calculation and 2 reducers for sorting.


8. Register the piggybank.jar file from '/usr/local/pig-0.13.0/lib/piggybank.jar' and then generate the symbol and reverse of every symbol


9. Look at the baseball dataset. Use describe command. What do you think is the datatype of the position field. Flatten this dataset and output the name of player and number of positions in which he has played. The output should be ordered in descending order of number of positions.



10. Using the baseball dataset, first flatten the positions column and then generate a listing of the count of players for each position in a descending order.


11. Group the NYSE_daily data by exchange and for each exchange find the count of symbols.


12. The number of entries in the divs table is less than daily table. Join them using a fragment replicated join. Check to see if a reduce phase is needed.


13. Create a co-group of daily and divs relations and find out those symbols that have never paid a dividend.


14. Use the crawl data and find for each page the number of outlinks and number of inlinks.
